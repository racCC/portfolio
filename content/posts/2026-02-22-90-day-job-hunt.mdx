## The Decision

I'm done waiting for the right moment. Starting **February 23, 2026**, I'm locking in for 90 days with one non-negotiable outcome: a job offer as a backend, full-stack, or AI engineer.

This post is my public commitment. If you're reading this, hold me accountable.

## Why 90 Days?

90 days is long enough to build real momentum and short enough to stay urgent. It's roughly 12 weeks — enough time to:

- Send 200+ tailored applications
- Solve 150+ DSA problems
- Master system design fundamentals
- Get interview-ready physically and mentally

The clock starts tomorrow. Here's the roadmap.

## The Four Pillars

### 1. Job Applications — Consistent, Targeted, Personal

No spray-and-pray. Every application gets a **tailored resume and cover letter** aligned to the role's stack and company culture. My targets are backend, full-stack, and AI engineer roles across Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, and Calgary.

**Weekly targets:**
- 15–20 applications sent
- 3–5 cold emails to recruiters or engineers
- 1–2 referral requests from my network
- Follow-up on every application past 7 days

Roles I'm targeting: Java/Spring Boot backend, Node.js/React full-stack, AI/LLM-integrated engineering, and cloud-native microservices positions.

---

### 2. DSA & Competitive Programming — Daily, Non-Negotiable

At **4 AM every morning**, before the day pulls me in every direction, I open LeetCode. No exceptions.

**The plan:**
- 2 problems per day minimum (Easy + Medium rotation)
- Weekly: 1 Hard problem
- Focus areas: Arrays, Trees, Graphs, DP, Sliding Window, Heap, and Two Pointers
- Every Saturday: mock interview session (timed, no hints)

I'm already past 300 problems. By day 90, I want to be at 450+ and genuinely comfortable with any medium-difficulty problem under 25 minutes.

### 3. System Design — Think Like a Senior Engineer

This is where junior candidates lose senior-targeting roles. I'm studying system design every evening, treating it like a craft.

**Weekly topics rotation:**
- Week 1–2: Fundamentals — load balancing, caching, databases, CAP theorem
- Week 3–4: Real systems — URL shortener, rate limiter, notification service
- Week 5–6: Distributed systems — Kafka, consistent hashing, leader election
- Week 7–8: Cloud-native — microservices patterns, API gateways, container orchestration
- Week 9–10: AI/ML systems — LLM pipelines, vector DBs, RAG architectures
- Week 11–12: Mock design interviews + review weak areas

Every week I'll document one system design breakdown right here on this blog.

### 4. Gym + Eating Clean — The Non-Negotiable Foundation

I've learned that job hunting is a mental game. Discipline bleeds across all areas of your life — if I'm consistent in the gym and in the kitchen, I'll be consistent with applications and code too.

**Training:** 5 days a week, strength + cardio split. No skipped sessions unless I'm sick.

**Nutrition:** Clean eating starting tomorrow. Protein-first meals, no junk during the week, meal prepped on Sundays. Hydration tracked.

The goal isn't aesthetics — it's mental sharpness, better sleep, and showing up every day with energy.

---

## Weekly Check-In Structure

Every Sunday I'll post a short update on this blog covering:

- Applications sent that week and response rates
- DSA problems solved and key learnings
- System design topic studied
- Gym attendance
- One honest reflection — what worked, what didn't

Transparency is the point. Progress in public builds accountability.

---

## The Stack I'm Betting On

My strongest areas going into this sprint:

- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot 3, Node.js, REST APIs, microservices
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Next.js
- **AI/LLM:** GPT-4, Gemini, Claude API integrations, RAG pipelines
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis

If a role touches any combination of these, I'm applying — and I'll be ready.

---

## Day 90 Target

By **May 23, 2026**, I will have a signed offer letter. That's the only acceptable outcome.

If you're on a similar journey — grinding applications, studying nights, trying to break through — I'd love to connect. Let's hold each other accountable.

The work starts tomorrow. Let's go.
