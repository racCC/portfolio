## Why a Blog?

I've been building things quietly for a while — Spring Boot microservices, AI-powered tools, cloud-native apps. The code ships, the projects launch, and then the thinking behind all of it disappears.

This blog is where that thinking lives.

## What to Expect

Expect posts about:

- **Backend systems** — Java, Spring Boot, microservices patterns, designing APIs that don't embarrass you six months later
- **AI tooling** — practical use of LLM APIs (Gemini, GPT-4o), LangChain, and how to build AI features without the hype
- **Cloud & DevOps** — AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, the stuff that runs everything
- **Frontend** — Next.js, React, the occasional Tailwind deep-dive

No fluff. No "10 reasons why X is better than Y." Just honest engineering writing.

## Currently Building

Right now I'm working on improving this portfolio site and documenting what I learn along the way. If you're reading this, the MDX pipeline works — that's a win.

Stay tuned.
